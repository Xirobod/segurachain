<h2>SeguraChain is experimental, do not use it like he is, until the stable release is complete and available.</h2>

Summary: SeguraChain (Secured Chain translated from Spanish) is a technology developed mainly in C#,
it allows to easily create and understand a decentralized blockchain process, it can be configured to support a sovereign update system,
allowing to include updates on it without editing the content of the Blockchain. 

It was developed to update Xiropht which is a centralized cryptocurrency, once the stable version is complete.

<h4>For now be sure to use the current version centralized of Xiropht: https://xiropht.com/</h4>
<h4>Official Github of Xiropht current version: https://github.com/XIROPHT</h4>

<h4>It will also make it possible to further trivialize cryptocurrencies, because this technology is simple to set up,
indirectly this will increase the difficulty for those who wish to create one to distinguish
from the moment when users in general will understand that it is simple.
When a product, a task to be accomplished becomes simple, the final value of this one generally becomes much lower over time.
Which should allow users to be more vigilant.</h4>

Please read the whitepaper document, the document is available in french only and at the moment and 2 parts of the whitepaper
who explain some important process are not written into this one.

Once the whitepaper is complete, I will make the translation of this one into english.

Everything has been developed in C#, and support Net5, a downgrade to NetFramework 4.8 is available.
Other technical informations available on the whitepaper:
<h5>ECDSA with SHA3-512, Curve: SECT571R1</h5>

<h5>Visual Studio 2019 16.9 is required.</h5>

More upgrades of the project will coming soon, the complete version should be done the 1st July.

Every devs and potential users can send me their returns about the project, potential fix, issues and more.
